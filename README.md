# Senkode
Costum encryption by Takaso and Komodo

# Getting started
* clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/takaso/senkode/`
* start the script: `python3 main.py`

## Usage
while you're editing the code (we made this not 'cause we are lazy, but to avoid skids who can't code), you can set a numeric key, and then use the functions `encrypt` and `decrypt` like in the examples to respectively encrypt, and decrypt words!
